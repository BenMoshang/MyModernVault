```You are tasked with converting an [DJANGO] web application from standard CSS to SCSS, while ensuring best practices for maintainability, consistency, and scalability. Each component in this web application contains both HTML and CSS.

Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Convert CSS to SCSS**: Ensure that each component's CSS is converted into SCSS, following best practices.
   
2. **BEM Naming Conventions**: Apply the **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** naming conventions to ensure consistent class naming across all SCSS files. Example:
   - `.block { }`
   - `.block__element { }`
   - `.block__element--modifier { }`

3. **SCSS Optimization for Reusability**:
   - Define variables for common values (e.g., colors, fonts, breakpoints).
   - Create mixins and functions where applicable, ensuring these are modular and reusable across different components.
   - Document your SCSS, explaining key decisions made around variables, mixins, and functions.

4. **Scoped Styling**: Ensure each component's styles are properly scoped to avoid style leakage or conflicts with other components in the application.

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the mobile responsiveness of the application is preserved during the conversion, using SCSS features like mixins for breakpoints.

6. **Post-Conversion Review**: After converting each component, review its functionality and styling, ensuring no regressions in behavior or appearance. Use the following grading criteria for each component:
   - **Consistency**: Uniform application of SCSS styles across components (Score: X/10)
   - **BEM Compliance**: Proper application of BEM conventions (Score: X/10)
   - **SCSS Optimization**: Efficient use of SCSS variables, mixins, and functions for reusability (Score: X/10)
   - **Mobile Responsiveness**: Mobile responsiveness is preserved (Score: X/10)
   - **Functionality**: No loss of functionality after conversion (Score: X/10)

7. **Final SCSS Output**: For each component, output the final SCSS code, ensuring it is formatted and ready to be integrated into the project. Do not include placeholder commentsâ€”only fully implemented and formatted SCSS code.

8. **Component Report**: After reviewing each component, provide a detailed report with a score out of 10 for each criterion, including:
   - A summary of what was done well.
   - Areas for improvement.
   - Any recommendations for future improvements in SCSS architecture.

Finally, generate a final overall score for each component and an overall assessment of the SCSS conversion project.
